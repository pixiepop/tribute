  <h6>A little about Ada's life</h6>
   <div class="col-11 mx-auto" style="padding-bottom: 30px">
    <ul>
    
      <li>Ada Lovelace is known for her mathematical works in collaboration with the "Father of the Computer", Charles Babbage.</li>
      <li> Ada was initiated into the profession by her mother, who feared that poetry would spoil the young woman's morals.</li>
      <li> Ada also harboured a love for poetry, and preferred to blend the seemingly unrelated subjects, in her work.</li>
      <li> Ada liked calling herself an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)", working on what could be termed "poetical science".</li>
      <li> Her initial works with Babbage, earned her fame and recognition.</li>
      <li> Ada's private life was full of confusion and heartbreak, she made up for by her astounding scientific work.</li>
      <li> Despite a short life, Lovelace left her mark in the history of mathematics and computers.</li>
    </ul>
